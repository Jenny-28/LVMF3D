# LVMF3D: Large Vision Model Boosting Multimodal Fusion for indoor 3D Object Detection

3D object detection plays an important role in intelligent systems perceiving the world. Although many studies have been conducted to address this task, the detection accuracy is still limited by the networkâ€™s learning capability. Therefore, we
propose LVMF3D, a Large Vision Model (LVM) boosted multimodal fusion indoor 3D object detection framework, consisting of two branches. The pre-trained LVM is used as the RGB branch to better extract the image texture feature. The point branch is used to encode spatial geometric feature. Furthermore, Point Fusion Module (PFM) and Multi-Scale Attention Fusion Module (MSAFM) are specially designed in the 2D and 3D spaces respectively, to realize more comprehensive and effective information fusion between the two branches. We conduct experiments on the indoor 3D object detection dataset SUN RGB-D and achieve state-of-theart results compared to other 3D object detection methods.
